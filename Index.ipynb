We are architecting a precision retrieval pipeline to ingest data directly from the eKLR (Kenya Law) repository, which is the official publisher of the Laws of Kenya. While eKLR has successfully digitized the nation’s legal archives, this data currently exists as static, unstructured text—readable by humans, but opaque to machines. \n",
