CLAIMANT AND CINE INVESTMENT LIMITED .................................................. 1ST RESPONDENT NATIONAL LAND COMMISSION ............................................ 2ND RESPONDENT BUSINESS REGISTRATION SERVICE ...................................... 3RD RESPONDENT RULING 1. This matter comes up for directions today in respect of the Claimant’s Statement of Claim and Application dated 12th September 2025. In the application \\ue000led under Certi\\ue000cate of Urgency, the Claimant seeks, inter alia, leave to serve the 1st Respondent through substituted service and issuance of a temporary injunction against the 4th Respondent (sic) restraining the said Respondent from continuing with the process of compulsory acquisition in respect of a notice of intention to acquire published in Kenya Gazette Notice number 2372 of 24th February 2023. 2. The Claimant avers that the suit is \\ue000led in the public interest to protect public funds from possible fraud. It is alleged that the 1st Respondent is a fraudulent entity that has been established with the intention to carry out fraudulent unlawful, illegal activities which involves taking of public funds from the 2nd Respondent. The Claimant further avers that she has been unable to con\\ue000rm the legal status of the 1st Respondent through a search at the 3rd Respondent’s registry and platform. She, therefore, avers that the 1st Respondent “does not exist in law and statutory records.” 3. Having perused the instant application and the Statement of Claim, I make the following observations: a. The instant suit is similar to another suit which was struck out by this tribunal for lack of jurisdiction being Esmail v Abdeel Enterprises Limited & 3 others [2025] KELAT 173 (KLR), https://new.kenyalaw.org/akn/ke/judgment/kelat/2025/194/eng@2025-10-08 1 where the Tribunal made a determination that the dispute in the case involved a question of the legal status of the then 3rd Respondent who is now the 1st Respondent. b. The present suit similarly invites the Tribunal to venture into matters beyond its jurisdiction. The Claimant purports that the 1st Respondent is engaged in fraud but at the same time alleges that the said entity does not exist. These are matters within the mandate of the Ethics and AntiCorruption Commission. c. Even though the Claimant purports to \\ue000le the instant suit “in the public interest” the background makes it clear that the Claimant is pursuing an underlying dispute before the wrong forum. It is a classic case of abuse of the court process. Munyao Sila, J in County Council of Nandi vs. Ezekiel Kibet Rutto & 6 Others [2013] eKLR observed as follows: A pleading that is an abuse of the process of Court in my view encompasses scandalous, frivolous, or vexatious pleadings but goes a little further to take care of situations that may not otherwise be encapsulated in the de\\ue000nition of the three preceding words. They can encompass a situation where a litigant is using the process of court in the wrong way, not for purposes of agitating a right, but for other extraneous reasons 4. Courts of law are not powerless when faced with outright abuse of their processes. Such abuse must be stopped right in its tracks. As observed in County Council of Nandi (supra): The court through the provisions of Order 2 Rule 15 is given leeway to strike out pleadings that are scandalous, frivolous, vexatious or otherwise an abuse of the process of court. Before striking out such pleading, the court needs to make an examination whether such pleadings are scandalous, frivolous, vexatious or otherwise an abuse of the process of law. If they are, then a court would be perfectly entitled to strike such pleadings out because essentially it is not fair and neither is it worthy having a defendant shoulder the burden of such litigation. 5. It is my \\ue000nding that the pleadings in this case are an abuse of the court process and pursuant to Order 2 Rule 15 (1) (d) of the Civil procedure Rules, I hereby strike out the suit in its entirety with no orders as to costs as the Respondents have not \\ue000led any responses.

APPLICANT AND PET CARE SERVICES LIMITED ....................................................... RESPONDENT RULING A. Background 1. The Respondent/Landlord \\ue000led a Notice of Preliminary Objection dated 18th August 2025 seeking to strike out the consolidated references in BPRT E360 of 2025 and BPRT E550 of 2025, contending that the tenancies between the parties are not controlled tenancies within the meaning of Section 2 of the Landlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotels and Catering Establishments) Act (Cap 301, Laws of Kenya). 2. The Landlord’s objection is anchored on two main grounds: that the lease agreements are for terms exceeding \\ue000ve years and therefore outside the purview of controlled tenancies, and that the Tribunal therefore lacks jurisdiction to hear and determine the dispute. 3. The Tenant/Applicant opposed the objection through submissions dated 5th September 2025, arguing that the leases in question contain termination clauses capable of invocation by either party before the expiry of \\ue000ve years, and are therefore controlled tenancies under Section 2(1)(b)(ii) of Cap 301. B. Issues for Determination 4. The issues for determination are as follows: i. Whether the Preliminary Objection meets the established legal threshold. https://new.kenyalaw.org/akn/ke/judgment/kebprt/2025/423/eng@2025-10-09 1 ii. Whether the tenancies between the parties qualify as controlled tenancies under Section 2 of Cap 301 so as to confer jurisdiction on this Tribunal. iii. Who is liable to pay costs of the objection? C. Analysis and Determination i. Whether the Preliminary Objection Meets the legal threshold 5. In the celebrated case of Mukisa Biscuit Manufacturing Co. Ltd v West End Distributors Ltd [1969] EA 696, Law J.A. stated: “A preliminary objection consists of a point of law which has been pleaded, or which arises by clear implication out of pleadings, and which if argued as a preliminary point may dispose of the suit.” 6. Similarly, in Oraro v Mbaja [2005] eKLR, Ojwang J. (as he then was) emphasized that: “A preliminary objection cannot be raised if any fact has to be ascertained or if what is sought is the exercise of judicial discretion.” 7. In the present matter, the Landlord’s objection is premised on the assertion that the leases are for terms exceeding \\ue000ve years and are therefore, not controlled. However, the existence and interpretation of termination clauses within the leases are contested factual issues requiring the Tribunal to examine the actual lease documents, their wording, and the intention of the parties. 8. Such examination takes the objection beyond the realm of pure law into factual inquiry, contrary to the principles laid down in Mukisa Biscuit and Oraro v Mbaja. Therefore, the objection does not qualify as a pure point of law capable of disposing of the suit in limine. ii Whether the Leases Create Controlled Tenancies Under Section 2 of Cap 301 9. Section 2(1)(b)(ii) of Cap 301 de\\ue000nes a controlled tenancy as one which inter-alia: “... has been reduced into writing and which contains provision for termination, otherwise than for breach of covenant, within \\ue000ve years from the commencement thereof.” 10. The Tenant has demonstrated through annexed copies of the leases that each of them contains a termination clause permitting either party to terminate the tenancy by notice before the expiry of \\ue000ve years. 11. The Court of Appeal in Khalif Jele Mohamed & another v Republic [2019] eKLR held that: “If such a tenancy has provision for termination, which can be invoked at any time during the term, it is a controlled tenancy under Section 2(1)(b)(ii) of Cap 301.” 12. Likewise, in Githiomi v Maina [2025] KECA 175, the Court observed that: “Although the lease was for a period exceeding \\ue000ve years, the presence of a termination clause capable of invocation by either party within the \\ue000rst \\ue000ve years rendered it a controlled tenancy within the meaning of Section 2 of Cap 301.” https://new.kenyalaw.org/akn/ke/judgment/kebprt/2025/423/eng@2025-10-09 2 13. This reasoning has also been consistently followed by the Tribunal, as in Salat v Nnicom Investment Co. Ltd (BPRT E1026/2022), where it was held that: “A tenancy agreement that contains a mutual termination clause permitting termination otherwise than for breach and within \\ue000ve years from commencement is a controlled tenancy under Section 2(1)(b)(ii).” 14. The Tribunal \\ue000nds that the leases herein fall squarely within this principle. The existence of mutual termination provisions brings the tenancies within the statutory de\\ue000nition of controlled tenancies, thereby conferring jurisdiction on this Tribunal to entertain the dispute. 15. The Landlord relied heavily on Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd v Popatlal Madhavji & Bros. [2019] eKLR, Nilerch Investment Co. v Ontulili Investment Ltd (BPRT E1119/2023), and Omega Fire Ministries Int’l v Paragon Property Consultants Ltd (BPRT E1044/2024) to argue that the leases herein are not controlled. 16. These authorities are, however, distinguishable. In Popatlal (supra), the lease did not contain any termination clause. Similarly, in Nilerch and Omega Fire Ministries, the Tribunal found that the user of the premises was not a shop, hotel, or catering establishment, and that the leases lacked early termination provisions. 17. In contrast, the present leases relate to business premises used for the Tenant’s security services and training business, which falls within the commercial category contemplated by Cap 301, and contain express mutual termination clauses exercisable otherwise than for breach and within \\ue000ve years. 18. The distinguishing feature in the cited cases is therefore the absence of a termination clause, which is precisely the element that brings the present tenancy within the ambit of Cap 301. iii On Jurisdiction 19. The Landlord’s argument that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction is untenable once it is established that the tenancies are controlled within the meaning of Section 2. The Tribunal’s jurisdiction under Section 12(1) of Cap 301 extends to all controlled tenancies, and once such a tenancy is shown to exist, this Tribunal must exercise its statutory mandate. 20. The invocation of The Owners of Motor Vessel “Lillian S” v Caltex Oil (Kenya) Ltd [1989] KLR 1 on the doctrine of jurisdiction is therefore misplaced, as the factual foundation of jurisdiction under Cap 301 has been properly demonstrated. iv. Costs 21. Section 12(1)(k) of Cap 301 expressly empowers this Tribunal to award costs as it deems \\ue000t. The provision states that the Tribunal may “award costs as it deems \\ue000t in any proceedings before it.” 22. In exercise of this discretion, the Tribunal is guided by the general principle that costs follow the event unless the circumstances dictate otherwise. Having found the Preliminary Objection unmerited, the costs shall follow the event. D. Final Orders 23. In the result, the Tribunal \\ue000nds and holds as follows: https://new.kenyalaw.org/akn/ke/judgment/kebprt/2025/423/eng@2025-10-09 3 a. The Preliminary Objection dated 18th August 2025 does not meet the threshold of a pure point of law. b. The leases between the parties contain termination clauses exercisable within \\ue000ve years, thereby qualifying as controlled tenancies under Section 2(1)(b)(ii) of the Landlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotels and Catering Establishments) Act (Cap 301). c. The Tribunal consequently has jurisdiction to hear and determine the consolidated matters. d. The Preliminary Objection is hereby dismissed with costs to the Tenant/Applicant. It is so ordered.

The Complaint arises from the Respondent’s publication of Gazette Notice No. 4055 dated 25 March 2024, and the subsequent Gazette Notice No. 16985 dated 25 November 2024, expressing an intention to compulsorily acquire a portion of the said community land on behalf of the Ministry of Interior and National Administration for the development of security infrastructure and a training facility. The Complainants contend that the impugned process was marred by procedural impropriety, lack of transparency, absence of public participation, and violations of their constitutional rights to property and community land as protected under Articles 40 and 63 of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010. The Complaint is premised on the assertion that the unlawful compulsory acquisition process threatens to deprive the Complainants and the wider Losesia Community of their ancestral land, livelihoods, and accrued benefits under a subsisting lease arrangement. The Complainants’ Case The substratum of the Complainants’ case, as gathered from the Statement of Complaint dated 18 February 2025, Affidavits and Statements on record, is that the compulsory acquisition process initiated and undertaken by the Respondent in respect of part of the suit property is unconstitutional, unlawful, procedurally flawed, and fundamentally inimical to the rights and interests of the Losesia community and its members. In particular, the Complainants contend that upon receipt of the request dated 29 February 2024, the Respondent failed to develop, publish, or apply the mandatory criteria and guidelines required under section 107(2) of the Land Act, 2012, a statutory condition precedent to any lawful compulsory acquisition. It is the Complainants’ aversion that the Respondent unlawfully published Gazette Notice No. 4055 of 25 March 2024 without first satisfying itself that funds for prompt and just compensation had been deposited by the acquiring authority, thereby violating Article 40 of the Constitution. The Complainants dispute the Respondent’s claim of proper publication and public participation, asserting that the alleged distribution of the Gazette Notice was conducted on a public holiday, without notice or invitation to the community, and that the Gazette Notice Distribution Register relied upon by the Respondent refers to a non-existent Gazette Notice, thus undermining its credibility. It is also the Complainants’ case that the alleged public inquiries conducted in January 2025 could not cure earlier illegality, as meaningful public participation presupposes timely, lawful, and adequate notice. The Complainants further challenge the Respondent’s decision to increase the acreage to be acquired from 2183.91 acres to 4675.84 hectares through Gazette Notice No. 16985, contending that the justification based on “security threats” and the inclusion of Kamanga Hills is speculative, unsupported by expert evidence, and arbitrary. The Complainants also deny that any lawful field inspections were conducted, noting that no inspection or valuation reports have been produced. The Complainants further point to alleged inconsistencies between the Respondent’s position and statements made by the Cabinet Secretary for Interior before the Senate Committee on Lands, which cast doubt on the legitimacy of the Corrigendum. The Complainants assert that the land targeted for acquisition is critical to their pastoral livelihood, dry-season grazing, access to water, and cultural heritage, and that no social, economic, or environmental impact assessment was undertaken. It is their contention that the Respondent failed to consider less intrusive alternatives, including the continuation or renegotiation of an existing lease benefiting the community. In sum, the Complainants aver that the Respondent’s actions violate Articles 10, 40, and 63 of the Constitution, as well as the Land Act and the Community Land Act, and urge the Tribunal to uphold the Complaint and grant the following reliefs sought: A Declaration do issue that the National Land Commission’s Notice of Intention to Compulsorily acquire Part of L.R. No. Samburu/East Waso/1 in Samburu County carried in Gazette Notice No. 4055 dated 25th March, 2024, and the Corrigendum to the initial Gazette Notice published in Gazette Notice No. 16985 dated 25th November, 2024 violated Articles 40(3) and 63 of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010, Sections 107, 110(1) and 111(a) of the Land Act No. 6 of 2012 and the same is therefore null and void. An Order of Certiorari do issue quashing the Commission’s decision in Gazette Notice No. 4055 dated 25th March, 2024 and Gazette Notice 16985 dated 25th November, 2024, intending to compulsorily acquire land outside the due process from the Complainants and other members of Losesia Community. An Order staying the intended exercise/process of acquisition of Part of L.R. No. Samburu/East Waso/1 in Samburu County until the final determination of the Complaint by the Honourable Tribunal. An Order do issue requiring the Commission to carry out proper consultations with affected members of the community and other third parties who have leased the Community Land like Kamanga Holdings Limited and the British Army before proceeding with any further acquisition steps. An Order do issue requiring the Commission and the acquiring authority to carry out a proper environmental, social and economic impact assessment before proceeding further with the process of compulsory acquisition. The Honourable Tribunal be pleased to hold and declare that the Respondent is not entitled to deprive the Complainants and Losesia Community Land members the benefits accruing from the subsisting Lease Agreement between Losesia Community and Kamanga Holdings otherwise than by compliance with the law and the due process of law. A conservatory order do issue restraining the Respondent, its officers, servants, agents from attempting to obtain possession or in any manner interfering with the Complainants’ proprietorship possession, custody and control of part of the property known as Land Reference No. Samburu/East Waso/1 in Samburu County. A permanent injunction restraining the National Land Commission and the Ministry of Interior and National Administration, its agents, servants and employees from encroaching or interfering with the Losesia Community Land, other than on the terms already existing as per the lease agreement already in force and dated 1st April, 2016. The Costs consequent upon this Complaint be borne by the Respondent. The Respondent’s Case The Respondent’s case through its Statement of Defence and Replying Affidavit dated 17 April 2025, is that the impugned compulsory acquisition process was lawful, procedurally sound, and undertaken in strict compliance with the Constitution and the Land Act, 2012. The Respondent maintains that it acted pursuant to a lawful request by the Ministry of Interior and National Administration dated 29 February 2024, seeking land for the development of security infrastructure and a training facility, a purpose it characterizes as unequivocally public in nature. The Respondent avers that it duly published Gazette Notice No. 4055 of 25 March 2024 in compliance with the law, conducted field inspections through its valuation officers, and subsequently issued a Corrigendum and Inquiry vide Gazette Notice No. 16985 of December 2024, lawfully varying the acreage to be acquired on account of security considerations, including the inclusion of Kamanga Hills. It further asserts that the notices were properly publicized, that the Losesia Community was notified, and that a substantive public inquiry was conducted between 15 and 17 January 2025, thereby satisfying the constitutional requirement of public participation. The Respondent denies any violation of Article 40, contending that compensation is guaranteed and that public interest, particularly national security, outweighs the community’s objections. The Respondent urges the Tribunal to dismiss the Complaint as unmeritorious. The Complainants’ Reply In a rejoinder, dated 6 May 2025, the Complainants maintain that the Respondent’s pleadings and evidence do not cure the foundational constitutional and statutory defects identified. They reiterate that failure to comply with section 107(2) of the Land Act deprived the Respondent of jurisdiction to proceed, that public participation was illusory and belated, and that the drastic expansion of the land to be acquired was arbitrary and unsupported by expert evidence. The Complainants further impugn the credibility of the Respondent’s documentation, deny that lawful field inspections were conducted, and highlight unexplained administrative delays, including the late registration of restrictions against the community title. The Complainants reiterate the grave socio-economic, cultural, and environmental prejudice arising from the intended acquisition and the Respondent’s failure to consider less intrusive alternatives. Accordingly, the Complainants urge the Tribunal to reject the Respondent’s defence, uphold the Statement of Complaint dated 18th February 2025, and grant the reliefs sought. Joinder of the Amicus Curiae The matter came up for hearing on 23 July 2025. Mr. Lenakio, assisted by Ms. Nelima, appeared for the Complainants, Mr. Haji appeared for the Respondent, and Ms. Angela Asiago, appeared on behalf of Kituo Cha Sheria as the proposed Interested Party. On 23 July 2025, the Tribunal was notified that Legal Advisory Centre (Kituo cha Sheria) had filed an application seeking to be joined as an interested party. Ms. Asiago who appeared on behalf of Kituo cha Sheria submitted that Kituo cha Sheria’s mandate in addressing historical and contemporary land injustices justified its participation for purposes of offering technical expertise and legal insight, without introducing new claims or occasioning delay. Ms. Asiago indicated that, if admitted, the organization would rely on a single witness statement limited to historical context and would otherwise confine itself to legal submissions. Counsel for the Complainants - Mr. Lenakio - raised no objection to the application. The Respondent, through Mr. Haji, opposed the joinder on the grounds that the application was made late in the proceedings, that the role of the proposed interested party was unclear, and that its participation would be duplicative given the witnesses already lined up by the Complainants. Upon considering the submissions, the Tribunal delivered an ex tempore ruling, finding that the application for joinder had been brought at an advanced stage and was likely to disrupt the proceedings, and that no sufficient interest had been demonstrated for the inclusion of the proposed interested. Nonetheless, the Tribunal acknowledged the expertise and mandate of Kituo cha Sheria and, acting suo motu, admitted the organization as Amicus Curiae, with its role strictly limited to addressing legal issues through submissions only, and without any participation in the leading or examination of evidence. Hearing Complainants’ Evidence At the commencement of the hearing, Counsel for the Complainants, Mr. Lenakio, informed the Tribunal that the Complainants were ready to proceed with three witnesses and a forensic document examiner. Counsel further indicated that the Complainants would abandon prayers (c), (d), (e), (g), and (h) of the Statement of Complaint. Counsel for the Respondent, Mr. Haji, indicated that the Respondent was ready to proceed with one witness. The Complainants’ first witness, Mr. Samuel Ledilas Lengila (CW1), was sworn in. He testified that he is a herder and trader by occupation and is currently pursuing a diploma course. He stated that he hails from Losesia and is a registered member of the Losesia Community, holding membership number 2345. CW1 testified that he wished to rely on his affidavit and witness statements dated 18 February 2025 and 20 June 2025, respectively. He produced the documents annexed to the Complaint dated 18 February 2025 as Exhibits 1–8, and a further list of documents dated 5 May 2025 as Exhibits 9–12. A further document was marked for identification as Exhibit CE13, pending production. CW1 disputed the assertion that the Ministry of Interior had developments on the suit land, stating that the land was currently occupied by Kamanga Holdings Limited pursuant to a lease agreement and that the developments on the land comprised a hotel and a camp, not military or security infrastructure. He further stated that he had previously been contracted at the hotel between 2018 and 2019. The witness testified that no notice of intention to compulsorily acquire the land was ever served upon the community, further stating that he only became aware of the alleged acquisition in January 2025. He went on to testify that his name did not appear in the distribution register prepared by the National Land Commission, which listed 360 persons, out of whom 107 had not appended their signatures. CW1 testified that the notice referred to in the distribution register did not exist as described, and that only a Gazette Notice dated 25 March 2024 had been issued. He maintained that the subsequent notice was never published to the community and that there was no notice dated 27 December 2024 as alleged. During cross-examination by Counsel – Mr. Haji for the Respondent, CW1 confirmed that he is a member of the Losesia Community and that the land in question is community land acknowledging that Kamanga Holdings Limited, was a private company owned by two individuals, and that this information was contained in the company’s memorandum of association. He stated that he did not believe the hotel was owned by the National Intelligence Service and that he was unaware of any role played by the NIS in relation to the land. He testified that he initially learned of the intended acquisition through rumours and later through his advocates. CW1 expressed uncertainty as to whether the letters requesting acquisition were duly signed, stating that the copy in his possession appeared unsigned, though counsel pointed out that the letter bore a signature. CW1 stated that while he understood the concept of compulsory acquisition, he believed that the process must strictly comply with procedural requirements. He testified that due diligence and public participation were not done. CW1, however, testified that he attended an inquiry conducted by the National Land Commission on 30 June 2025, though he did not raise any objections at the time. He stated that while community members and NLC officials were present, he did not know whether representatives of the Ministry of Interior or the NIS attended. He further stated that he could not ascertain whether funds for compensation had been set aside. On re-examination, CW1 testified that a hotel was under construction on the land as early as 2017. He reiterated that the letter attributed to the Cabinet Secretary, Kithure Kindiki, bore no visible signature and maintained that the community had not been adequately consulted or invited to participate in the acquisition process. The Complainants’ second witness, Mr. Geoffrey Ayub Lekiluai (CW2), was sworn in. He testified that he is an officer with the National Police Service and a registered member of the Losesia Community, holding membership number 334. He stated that he resides both in Elgisi Village and Nairobi. He adopted his witness statement dated 15 May 2025 as his evidence in chief. During cross-examination by Mr. Haji, CW2 testified that he objects to the compulsory acquisition process on the basis that the leased land constituted a significant source of income for the community, generating approximately Kshs. 12 million annually, in addition to bursaries and carbon credit benefits. He stated that the land also served as a critical water source through the Ewaso Nyiro River and that acquisition would adversely affect access to water. It was CW2’s testimony that the community had previously lost a portion of land to government acquisitions in the same area. He further stated that the land was currently occupied by Kamanga Holdings Limited and that he was not aware of any presence of the NIS on the land. CW2 expressed concern that the Respondent failed to conduct adequate due diligence by engaging the community to understand the actual use of the land. On re-examination, CW2 testified that the Losesia community comprises of approximately 2,500 members, yet consultations were limited to about 200 persons. He further stated that no funds had been deposited for purposes of compensation. The Complainants’ third witness, Benedict Lesimir (CW3), was sworn in. He testified that he resides in Losesia Location, Waso Ward, Samburu County, and is employed by the County Government as a Village Administrator. He stated that his role includes linking the County Government with the community and facilitating public participation. He adopted his witness statement dated 20 June 2025 as his evidence in chief. CW3 testified that the Respondent held a meeting in Losesia but that no notice was served upon him in his official capacity as Village Administrator. He stated that had proper notice been issued, it would have been communicated through the established administrative hierarchy. He further testified that substantial portions of community land had already been allocated for conservancies and security installations, significantly reducing land available to the community. He testified that information regarding the meeting was received informally and at short notice, resulting in attendance by only about 369 persons. He stated that the short notice undermined effective public participation. Under cross-examination, CW3 conceded that he was not a member of the Community Land Management Committee and did not hold a formal leadership position within the community. He nevertheless maintained that, pursuant to the Legal Notice his office ought to have been notified of the meeting. On re-examination, CW3 reiterated that pursuant to Legal Notive No. 280 of 2017, notice should be served through the ward and village administrative structures to facilitate meaningful public participation, and that no such notice was issued. The Complainants’ fourth witness, Mr. Daniel Gutu (CW4), a forensic document examiner, was sworn in. He testified that he has over twelve years’ experience as a forensic document examiner, having previously served with the Directorate of Criminal Investigations for fourteen years, and that he was trained in Khartoum, Sudan. CW4 testified that on 22 April 2025 he received instructions from Lenakio & Associates to examine disputed signatures appearing on documents marked A1–A35, including Gazette Notices and a distribution register relating to L.R. No. Samburu/East Waso/1 (Part). His task was to determine whether the signatures were made by the persons whose names appeared. He testified that his examination revealed that on several pages, the same person who wrote the names of participants also signed in the signature column, indicating that the listed individuals did not personally sign the documents. He identified multiple documents exhibiting similar characteristics and stated that his findings were supported by comparison charts. He testified that the first report was prepared and signed on 25 April 2025, while a second report dated 4 May 2025 concerned examination of signatures attributed to one Kadir Lepere, which he found to be dissimilar to the specimen signatures provided. Under cross-examination by Mr. Haji, the witness acknowledged that handwriting analysis involves subjective analysis but maintained that his conclusions were based on established methodologies and that his reports had no limitations. He stated that the signatures in question were forged and did not reflect attendance by the named individuals. On re-examination, CW4 reiterated that the same author wrote the names and signatures on the impugned documents, and that the proper practice when signing on behalf of another would be to sign one’s own signature and indicate “for,” which was not done in this case. With that testimony, the Complainants closed their case. Respondent’s Evidence The Respondent called its sole witness, Mr. Jacob Kipaa (RW1), who was duly sworn in. He testified that he is the Principal Valuation and Taxation Officer with the National Land Commission (NLC) and that he was the officer in charge of the compulsory acquisition the subject of these proceedings. RW1 testified that the acquisition in question was undertaken for purposes of security infrastructure in the area. He explained that the compulsory acquisition process begins with a formal request from the acquiring authority, in this case the Ministry of Interior. Upon receipt of such a request, the Commission publishes a Gazette Notice of intention to acquire the land. He testified that an initial Gazette Notice was published in 2014, followed by a subsequent Gazette Notice in 2024. Thereafter, the Commission conducted inquiries for purposes of identifying owners and interests in the land. He stated that valuation had since been completed and that the Commission was in the internal approval stage prior to requesting funds from the acquiring authority. RW1 further testified that due diligence was conducted, which included obtaining an official search confirming that the land was registered as community land. He stated that NLC officials visited the community and the specific area under occupation by Kamanga Holdings Limited. During this process, community members availed the Commission with documents including the original title, the community members’ register, the community registration certificate, and KRA PIN certificates. It was RW1’s testimony that during the inquiry process, no objections were lodged by the community. He stated that the only issue raised concerned the subsisting lease to Kamanga Holdings Limited and the benefits accruing therefrom. He asserted that such interests would be catered for during compensation and that the existence of a lease does not bar compulsory acquisition under the law. RW1 further testified that no objections were received from Kamanga Holdings Limited. He maintained that all statutory requirements were complied with, including publication and physical service of notices, which were pinned at the Chief’s offices. He stated that attendance registers were maintained and that the Chief attended the inquiries. RW1 testified that the Ministry of Interior instructed the Commission to acquire the land for security services and that the acquisition would include the hotel on the land, which, to his knowledge, belonged to the Ministry of Interior through the National Intelligence Service. He confirmed that inquiries were conducted and that attendance lists accurately reflected those who participated. He referred the Tribunal to Section 22(2) of the Community Land Act, stating that community land may be converted to public land through compulsory acquisition. He further testified that valuation had been completed and that, once approvals were obtained, the Commission would request funds from the Ministry of Interior, after which disbursement would be made to the Commission. According to RW1, availability of funds is addressed at the tail end of the acquisition process, after offers have been made, in accordance with the Land Act. RW1 also explained that the Corrigendum expanding the area of acquisition was issued following a request by the Ministry of Interior after identification of an adjacent hill posing a security risk. He stated that community members were involved in the survey process. RW1 testified that concerns regarding access to the Ewaso Nyiro River were addressed and that the acquisition did not block access, nor did it exclude the airstrip. He stated that the current developments on the land included a hotel and security infrastructure, including a communication mast and a shooting range, and that the hotel were not open to the public. RW1 confirmed the existence of a registered 15-year lease and maintained that the community would not lose benefits accruing under the lease, which would be paid until expiry. During cross-examination by Ms. Nelima who appeared alongside Mr. Lenakio, RW1 confirmed that he had worked with the Respondent for eight years. He testified that due diligence is an ongoing process conducted both before and after acquisition. He stated that he was not aware of any published criteria used to establish that the acquisition served a public purpose. RW1 conceded that no funds had been deposited by the acquiring authority at the time and stated that the Commission was only required to confirm availability of funds. He was referred to letters dated 29 February 2024 and 30 October 2024 requesting acquisition, and acknowledged that the placement of the signatures on the letters appeared unusual. He further conceded that the letter dated 29 February 2024 did not expressly identify the NIS as the acquiring entity. RW1 acknowledged that Kamanga Holdings Limited was not notified separately of the acquisition. He confirmed that the Gazette Notice was dated 25 March 2024 and that the distribution register referred to a Gazette Notice of 5 April 2024, explaining that the discrepancy related to the date of publication rather than issuance. He further testified that the Losesia community register contains 2,410 members and that approximately 400 persons attended the public participation meeting held on 10 October 2024. He conceded that the majority of attendees did not sign the attendance register. He further testified that notices were not published in newspapers and that meetings were fixed at the National Government Administration Offices (NGAO) rather than county offices. On further questioning, RW1 confirmed that Kamanga Holdings Limited is a private company and that the lease was for construction of a camp. He acknowledged that the Commission relied on a letter from the Director General of the National Intelligence Service regarding security threats and that no independent security report was produced. On re-examination by Mr. Haji, the witness testified that misplaced signatures on government correspondence were not an unusual in practice. He reiterated that the request for acquisition was made by the Cabinet Secretary for Interior and that the second letter from the Director General of NIS was merely a clarification issued as an agent of the Cabinet Secretary. He testified that the Land Act does not require attendance by two-thirds of community members during inquiries and that Section 22 of the Community Land Act refers to the Land Act. He reiterated that the existence of a lease does not bar compulsory acquisition and that the Community Land Management Committee was present during inquiries. He maintained that the acquisition did not block access to amenities. With that testimony, the Respondent closed its case. Analysis and Determination The Complainants filed written submissions dated 20 August 2025, and supplementary submissions dated 14 November 2025. In the submissions, the Complainants invited this Tribunal to interrogate whether the Respondent complied with the constitutional, statutory, and procedural safeguards governing compulsory acquisition of community land, and whether the impugned acquisition of part of L.R. No. Samburu/East Waso/1 met the threshold of public purpose, public interest, due process, public participation, and prompt compensation. The Complainants framed three broad issues for determination: first, whether the Respondent complied with the constitutional and statutory prerequisites for compulsory acquisition; second, whether the Respondent’s actions or omissions violated the Complainants’ rights to property, access to information, and public participation; and third, who should bear the costs of the Complaint. On compliance with due process, the Complainants anchor their case on Article 40(3) of the Constitution, Sections 107, 108, 110, 111 and 112 of the Land Act, 2012, and the jurisprudence in Patrick Musimba v National Land Commission & 4 Others [2016], which sets out, in a step-by-step manner, the lawful process of compulsory acquisition. They contend that the Respondent failed at the very first gatekeeping stage by accepting and acting upon an unsigned and allegedly unauthenticated request letter, purportedly emanating from the Director General of the National Intelligence Service, an officer not authorized under Section 107(1) of the Land Act to initiate compulsory acquisition. In support of this proposition, reliance was placed on Giciri Thuo & 151 Others v National Land Commission & 5 Others (Land Acquisition Petition No. 3 of 2024) and Registered Trustees Jamie Masjid Ahle Sunait Wal Jamait v Nairobi City County Government & Another (Tribunal Case E008 of 2025), where this Tribunal emphasized that the National Land Commission is not a mere conveyor belt and that requests from unauthorized entities are null and void. The Complainants further submit that the Respondent failed to develop, publish, or apply the criteria and guidelines required under Section 107(2) of the Land Act before approving the acquisition, thereby abdicating its constitutional duty to independently satisfy itself that the acquisition was genuinely for a public purpose or in the public interest. The Complainants further rely on Patrick Musimba v National Land Commission (supra) and Giciri Thuo & 151 Others (supra), asserting that public purpose cannot be assumed merely because it is asserted by an acquiring authority. With respect to the publication of the Gazette Notices, the Complainants argued that the Respondent violated Section 107(5) of the Land Act and Regulation 23 of the Land Regulations, 2017 by failing to properly notify the Complainants and the wider Losesia community. In this regard, they rely on the case of Ravaspaul Kyalo Mutisya v National Land Commission [2022] KEELC 881 (KLR) where the Court held that service of the preliminary notice on affected landowners is mandatory. The Complainants submit that publication in the Kenya Gazette alone, without personal service, local dissemination, or meaningful engagement, was inadequate, particularly given the high levels of illiteracy within the community. A central pillar of the Complainants’ case rests on the proper construction and application of Section 107(1) of the Land Act, 2012, particularly on who is legally empowered to initiate a request for compulsory acquisition. In this regard, the Complainants rely on the case of Registered Trustees Jamie Masjid Ahle Sunait Wal Jamait v Nairobi City County Government & Another (Tribunal Case E008 of 2025) where this Tribunal addressed the validity of requests from unauthorized entities. On the issue of compensation, the Complainants contend that the Respondent failed to comply with Section 111(1A) of the Land Act and Regulation 22 of the Land Regulations, which require confirmation and deposit of compensation funds prior to acquisition. They argue that there was no evidence that the acquiring authority had set aside or deposited funds, thereby exposing the community to the risk of dispossession without prompt and just compensation. In support of this assertion, the Complainants rely on Republic v National Land Commission & 2 Others ex parte Samuel MN Mweru & 5 Others [2018] eKLR where the court stated: …before the Commission acquires land on behalf of any authority it must ensure that the funds required for the said acquisition are placed at the disposal of the Commission… On alleged violation of constitutional rights, the Complainants submit that the Respondent’s omissions infringed their right to property under Article 40, right to access information under Article 35, and the national values of governance under Article 10, particularly public participation, transparency, and accountability. To advance their argument that the absence of meaningful engagement before publication of the Gazette Notices and the failure to disclose critical information rendered the process unconstitutional the Complainants rely on the case of Isaiah Otiato & 6 Others v County Government of Vihiga [2018] KEELC 1644 (KLR). Finally, on costs, the Complainants submit that the Respondent’s failure to adhere to constitutional and statutory requirements necessitated the institution of the Complaint and that costs should therefore follow the event. The Respondent in its submissions dated 17 September 2025, submits that the compulsory acquisition of part of LR No. Samburu/East Waso/1 was undertaken strictly in accordance with the Constitution and the Land Act, 2012. The Respondent asserts that the acquisition was initiated upon a valid request by the Ministry of Interior and National Administration, from the then Cabinet Secretary, pursuant to Section 107(1) of the Land Act, and was intended for the establishment of security infrastructure and a training facility in Samburu County, as contemplated under Article 40(3) of the Constitution. The Respondent maintains that all statutory steps were complied with, and that substantive and inclusive public inquiries were conducted within the affected community, and that adequate notice was afforded through Gazette publications and community engagements. On due diligence and the initiation of compulsory acquisition, the Respondent relies on Patrick Musimba v National Land Commission & 4 Others [2016] KEHC 5956 (KLR), and submits that the responsibility for assessing public purpose, suitability of land, and availability of funds lies squarely with the Commission. The Respondent further cited the same decision to support the proposition that Gazette notices constitute sufficient public notification. With regards to public participation, the Respondent places reliance on Mui Coal Basin Local Community & 15 Others v Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Energy & 17 Others [2017] eKLR, submitting that public participation does not confer a veto on individual community members, but requires intentional inclusivity and reasonable opportunity to be heard, which threshold was met in the present case. It was expressed by the Court that: Public participation does not dictate that everyone must give their views... To have such a standard would be to give a virtual veto power to each individual in the community to determine community collective affairs. A public participation programme must, however, show intentional inclusivity and diversity. Any clear and intentional attempts to keep out bona fide stakeholders would render the public participation programme ineffective and illegal by definition. Addressing the alleged violations of constitutional rights, the Respondent submits that no violation of Article 40 or other constitutional provisions had been demonstrated, noting that compensation had not yet crystallized and no deprivation had occurred. The Respondent relies on Anarita Karimi Njeru v Republic [1979] KEHC, in underscoring the principle that constitutional violations must be pleaded and proved with precision, which burden, the Respondent argues, the Complainants failed to discharge. In conclusion, the Respondent urges the Tribunal to find that the Complaint was premature, unsubstantiated, and devoid of merit, and to dismiss it in its entirety while affirming the legality and validity of the compulsory acquisition process. Kituo cha Sheria, the Amicus Curiae, filed its submissions confining its intervention strictly to points of law arising from the case. The Amicus submits that its submissions are intended to aid the Tribunal in navigating the legal framework governing compulsory acquisition of community land, public participation, and the protection of marginalised communities. The Amicus submits that compulsory acquisition of community land is subject to heightened constitutional safeguards under Articles 40(3) and 63 of the Constitution, which prohibit deprivation of property except for a public purpose, in accordance with the Constitution and enabling legislation, and upon prompt payment of just compensation. The Amicus emphasises that these requirements are not procedural niceties but jurisdictional preconditions to a lawful acquisition. In this regard, the Amicus places reliance was on Patrick Musimba v National Land Commission & 4 Others [2016] eKLR, where the Court affirmed that compliance with Article 40(3) and Part VIII of the Land Act is mandatory, and that public purpose alone cannot validate an acquisition process that falls short of constitutional and statutory thresholds. The Amicus further addresses the principle of proportionality, implicit in Articles 24 and 40 of the Constitution, submitting that compulsory acquisition must be a measure of last resort and must employ the least restrictive means available to achieve the intended public purpose. This position, it submits, was reinforced in Thuo & 151 Others v National Land Commission & 5 Others [2024] KELAT 1142 (KLR), where this Tribunal held that: … the exercise of eminent domain by the State should be exercised as a last resort. The disruptive nature of the exercise of eminent domain necessitates the State to consider all other possible or reasonable alternatives before embarking on the same. As noted in the National Land Policy (2009), state power to regulate private property rights through compulsory acquisition has neither been exercised effectively nor accountably. To strike a healthy balance between the State's power of eminent domain and private property rights, the State must ensure that it occasions the least disruption to private land owners when embarking on a project for the benefit of the public. This is especially so when the intended acquisition of land will occasion relocation of the project affected persons from their homes. In some cases, the project affected persons may have other deeper attachments to the land earmarked for acquisition such as ancestral ownership or the presence of graves of family members. As noted by the World Bank, whenever people are displaced, the human costs in terms of disruption to community cohesion, livelihood patterns and way of life, may go beyond what can be fully mitigated through standard compensation, however generous those may be. On public participation and fair administrative action, the Amicus submits that Article 10 of the Constitution entrenches public participation as a binding national value, while Article 47 and the Fair Administrative Action Act, 2015 impose a duty of adequate notice, meaningful engagement, and reasoned decision-making. The Amicus further argues that Gazette publication alone is insufficient where affected persons are identifiable, relying on Virendra Ramji Gudka & 3 Others v Attorney General [2014] eKLR, where the Court held that actual notice must be effected in such circumstances. The Amicus Curiae further relies on Robert N. Gakuru & Others v Governor, Kiambu County [2014] eKLR to the effect that public participation must be real, inclusive, and timely, and not a perfunctory or token exercise. The Amicus also draws guidance from the Supreme Court decision in British American Tobacco Kenya PLC v Cabinet Secretary for Health & 2 Others [2019] KLR, which articulates the governing principles on public participation, including that the obligation to facilitate participation rests on the public authority, that participation must be substantive rather than cosmetic, and that adequacy of engagement is to be assessed contextually. It submits that these principles apply with greater force in matters affecting community land and marginalised groups. On the issue of protection of marginalised communities, the Amicus submits that compulsory acquisition affecting community land must be assessed through the lens of Articles 27, and 56 of the Constitution, which impose obligations of equality, non-discrimination, and affirmative protection of vulnerable groups. It relies on Centre for Minority Rights Development (Kenya) & Minority Rights Group International on behalf of Endorois Welfare Council v Kenya (ACHPR Communication No. 276/2003), where it was held that dispossession of community land without adequate consultation and culturally appropriate safeguards violated principles of equality and property rights. The Amicus further cites the decision of the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights in African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights v Republic of Kenya (Ogiek Case), Application No. 006/2012, where the Court held that eviction of the Ogiek people from Mau Forest without free, prior, and informed consent violated rights to property, culture, and natural resources, and emphasised that monetary compensation alone may be insufficient where ancestral or culturally significant land is involved. The Amicus submits that, by virtue of Articles 2(5) and 2(6) of the Constitution, these principles form part of Kenyan law and must inform the interpretation of Articles 40 and 63. It was further submitted by the Amicus that the State has a duty of environmental stewardship and sustainable management of natural resources, and that community land, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions, plays a critical ecological and livelihood role. In conclusion, the Amicus urges the Tribunal to approach the exercise of eminent domain as a constitutionally constrained power that demands strict adherence to due process, proportionality, meaningful public participation, and heightened protection of community and marginalised land rights. From the pleadings and submissions filed, we have summed the issues for determination into three being: Whether the process of compulsory acquisition was complied with in light of community land. Whether the rights of the Complainants under Article 40 of the Constitution have been violated. Whether the Respondent complied with the statutory requirements on compensation. The other sub-issues identified by the parties will be analysed within the main issues identified. The process of compulsory acquisition of land is stipulated in the Land Act, 2012. Relevant to this analysis will also be the provisions of the Community Lands Act, 2016. The statutory procedure of compulsory acquisition of land gives effect to the requirement under Article 40 (3) of the Constitution of Kenya that, “The State shall not deprive a person of property of any description…unless the deprivation – (b) is for a public purpose or in the public interest and is carried out in accordance with this Constitution and any Act of Parliament that - …” This process commences with a request from the county or national government for acquisition of land for a public purpose or in the public interest and terminates with the payment of compensation and vesting of land in government. For a deeper understanding of the issues raised in this matter, it is necessary to quote in extenso the summary laid down by the authoritative case of Patrick Musimba vs. National Land Commission & 4 Others (2016) eKLR which stated as follows: “85. In summary, the process of compulsory acquisition now runs as follows: 86. Under Section 107 of the Land Act, the National Land Commission (the 1st Respondent herein) is ordinarily prompted by the National or County Government through the Cabinet Secretary or County Executive Member respectively. The land must be acquired for a public purpose or in the public interest as dictated by Article 40(3) of the Constitution. In our view, the threshold must be met; the reason for the acquisition must not be remote or fanciful. The National Land Commission needs to be satisfied in those respects and this it can do by undertaking the necessary diligent inquiries including interviewing the body intending to acquire the property. 87. Under Sections 107 and 110 of the Land Act, the National Land Commission must then publish in the gazette a notice of the intention to acquire the land. The notice is also to be delivered to the Registrar as well as every person who appears to have an interest in the land. 88. As part of the National Land Commission due diligence strategy, the National Land Commission must also ensure that the land to be acquired is authenticated by the survey department for the rather obvious reason that the owner be identified. In the course of such inquiries, the National Land Commission is also to inspect the land and do all things as may be necessary to ascertain whether the land is suitable for the intended purpose. See Section 108 of the Land Act. 89. The foregoing process constitutes the preliminary or pre-inquiry stage of the acquisition. 90. The burden at this stage is then cast upon the National Land Commission and as can be apparent from a methodical reading of Sections 107 through 110 of the Land Act, the landowner’s role is limited to that of a distant bystander with substantial interest. 91. Section 112 of the Land Act then involves the landowner directly for purposes of determining proprietary interest and compensation. The Section has an elaborate procedure with the National Land Commission enjoined to gazette an intended inquiry and the service of the notice of inquiry on every person attached. The inquiry hearing determines the person interested and who are to be compensated. The National Land Commission exercises quasi-judicial powers at this stage. 92. On completion of the inquiry the National Land Commission makes a separate award of compensation for every person determined to be interested in the land and then offers compensation. The compensation may take either of the two forms prescribed. It could be a monetary award. It could also be land in lieu of the monetary award, if land of equivalent value, is available. Once the award is accepted, it must be promptly paid by the National Land Commission. Where it is not accepted then the payment is to be made into special compensation account held by the National Land Commission. See Sections 113-119 of the Land Act. 93. The process is completed by the possession of the land in question being taken by the National Land Commission once payment is made even though the possession may actually be taken before all the procedures are followed through and no compensation has been made. The property is then deemed to have vested in the National or County Government as the case may be with both the proprietor and the Land Registrar being duly notified. See Sections 120-122 of the Land Act. 94. If land is so acquired the just compensation is to be paid promptly in full to persons whose interests in land have been determined. See Section 111 of the Land Act. This is in line with the Constitutional requirement under Article 40(3) of the Constitution that no person shall be deprived of his property of any description unless the acquisition is for a public purpose and subjected to prompt payment in full of just compensation.” The Complainants have challenged the impugned compulsory acquisition process right from its commencement. It is the Complainants’ case that the impugned process was not properly commenced for the reason that the request for acquisition was not submitted by the National or County Government as required by law. Mr. Lenakio submitted that the use of the word “shall” under Section 107 of the Land Act implies a mandatory requirement in the commencement of the process of compulsory acquisition of land. In this regard, the Complainants assert that the Director General of an acquiring entity has no powers to request for an acquisition. Mr. Lenakio urges us to consider the mischief behind the legal provisions requiring these processes to be adhered to. Specifically, Mr. Lenakio contends that there is history of abuse of compulsory acquisition of land in Kenya. He urges us to rely on our decision in Registered Trustees of Jamie Masjid (supra) where we found that the now defunct Nairobi Metropolitan Services did not have powers to request the National land Commission to acquire land on its behalf. Section 107 (1) of the Land Act stipulates as follows in this regard: Whenever the national or county government is satisfied that it may be necessary to acquire some particular land under Section 110, the respective Cabinet Secretary or the County Executive Committee Member shall submit a request for acquisition of land to the Commission to acquire the land on its behalf. Emphasis added. The evidence before us demonstrates that the Cabinet Secretary – Ministry of Interior & National Administration wrote to the Respondent on 29 February 2024 requesting the Respondent to acquire 2183.91 acres being part of the suit property (Samburu/East Waso/1) for the development of security infrastructure and a training facility. Subsequently on 30 October 2024, the Director General of the National Intelligence Service wrote another letter to the Respondent referencing the 29 February 2024 letter and requesting the Respondent to amend the area of acquisition from the initial 2183.91 acres to 4675.84 acres which area now included an adjacent hill. The 30 October 2024 letter makes reference to a survey exercise which had been conducted pursuant to the publication of the notice of intention to acquire following the initial request. In the relevant part, the letter states: “Following the gazettement of the land on 25th March 2024, you assisted us in conducting a reconnaissance survey, whereby we established that the land was not accurately marked. Additionally, the gazetted parcel did not include the adjacent hill, which, if left unacquired, could pose a security threat to the establishment.” From this evidence, it is clear to us that the request for acquisition originated from the relevant Cabinet Secretary through the letter dated 29 February 2024. The evidence further demonstrates that the Director General of the acquiring entity followed up on the requested acquisition through a letter dated 30 October 2024 wherein a request for an amendment of the area to be acquired was requested following a joint survey exercise between the Respondent and the acquiring entity. It is our finding that this subsequent letter did not amount to a request for acquisition pursuant to Section 107(1) of the Land Act as alleged by the Complainants. The letter clearly makes reference to the request for acquisition from the Cabinet Secretary and follows up on a survey exercise that had been conducted by the Respondent. A request for correction of the area to be acquired by the acquiring entity does not amount to a fresh request for acquisition. The instant case is, therefore, distinguishable from our determination in Registered Trustees of Jamie Masjid (supra) where the Nairobi Metropolitan Services had purported to request for an acquisition. In regard to this first step, it is also the Complainants’ assertion that the letters from the Cabinet Secretary and the Director General are not signed. We have scrutinized the two documents and also considered the testimony of RW1. On the face of the two documents, we can ascertain that the same contain signatures but at the end of the letters. The signatures do not align with the authors of the letters. In his testimony, RW1 states that this is not an unusual practice with letters from government offices. It appears to us that the letters originated from the relevant offices and no evidence has been led to show the contrary. It is also clear that they contain signatures although not in the ordinary place against their names. The presence of signatures on the two letters demonstrate that the authors authenticated the contents in the letters. It is upon the Complainants to show otherwise. We, therefore, do not find anything to suggest that the letters are unsigned and did not originate from the relevant offices. The Complainants have also impugned the acquisition process on the allegation that notices were not served on the project affected persons as required under the law. In this regard, Mr. Lenakio submitted before us that the Respondent failed to comply with Section 107(5) of the Land Act. Section 107 (5) provides as follows: Upon approval of a request under subsection (1), the Commission shall publish a notice to that effect in the Gazette and the county Gazette, and shall deliver a copy of the notice to the Registrar and every person who appears to the Commission to be interested in the land. We have had occasion to explicate on the importance of notices for compulsory acquisition of land in James Finlays (Kenya) Ltd vs. National Land Commission and County Government of Kericho [2024] Tribunal 79 (KLR) where we stated as follows: 26…the intention of a notice is to inform the affected persons of the intended acquisition, but it doesn’t stop there. The notice serves to notify the affected party of the intended acquisition and to further give an opportunity to such a party to be satisfied that the intended acquisition complies with the Constitution and that their views and concerns are taken into account in the process. The evidence before us through the testimony of Mr. Jacob Kipaa demonstrates that the Respondent posted the notices of intention to acquire and inquiry at the National Government Administration Offices. It is also clear from the evidence that the project affected persons in this acquisition was the Losesia community. The law requires the Respondent to publish a notice of intention to acquire and to serve the same on every person who appears to be interested in the land. In the case of community land, it is sufficient that the notice is delivered to the community officials on behalf of the community. It would not be reasonable to expect the Respondent to serve the notice on each and every member of the community. It is expected that the community officials will bring this notice to the attention of their members through their channels of communication. It is also prudent for the Commission to cause the notice to be published in other prominent areas within the community where members of the community are likely to come across it. Indeed, Section 131(1)(d) of the Land Act provides as follows: A notice which may be given under this Part may be served on a person – ………… (d)if the person is a body corporate, society or other association of persons, by serving it personally on a secretary, director or other officer thereof or on a person concerned or acting in the management thereof, or by leaving it or sending it by registered post addressed to the body corporate, society, or, if there is no registered office, at any place where it carries on business, or, if there is none, by leaving it with the occupier of the land concerned, or, if there is no occupier, by affixing it upon some prominent part of the land; We, therefore, find and hold that the Complainants and the members of the Losesia community were adequately served with the notices of intention to acquire and inquiry as required under the law. Concomitant to the requirement for service of notices is the inquiry. The Complainants have disputed the inquiry conducted in this regard and averred that the same was inadequate. The Complainants contest the list of attendees in the said public participation. On its part, the Respondent contends that it complied with the law in carrying out the public engagement in the form of an inquiry. The Respondent avers that there is no requirement in the Land Act for attendance of two-thirds of the members of the community in a compulsory acquisition exercise as required for a sale under the Community Lands Act. It is uncontested that an inquiry was conducted on 10 October 2024 in the presence of some members of the Losesia community. Indeed, CW1 confirmed that he was among those who attended the inquiry. Although the Complainants have presented evidence contesting some signatures on the attendance forms, on the face of it, the Respondent has demonstrated that an inquiry was conducted. We have also considered the Respondent’s evidence and testimony of Mr. Jacob Kipaa that the community officials attended the inquiry and presented ownership documents together with the registration certificate for the community and community register. Mr. Kipaa further testified that they received no objections during the inquiry and that all the concerns that had been raised were addressed at the inquiry. However, the unique circumstances of community land requires the Respondent to adopt a nuanced approach to the inquiry. In this regard and considering an inquiry as a public participation exercise, we are guided by the Supreme Court determination in British American Tobacco Kenya PLC v Cabinet Secretary for Health & 2 Others [2019] KLR, which laid down the governing principles on public participation and specifically the requirement that public participation must be substantive rather than cosmetic, and that adequacy of engagement is to be assessed contextually. Considering the likelihood of low literacy levels in the affected communities as submitted by Mr. Lenakio, the Respondent has bigger role to play in facilitating a meaningful inquiry and to take measures to mitigate the impact of the acquisition on the affected community. The Amicus submits that compulsory acquisition of community land requires a consideration of other unique perspectives relevant to protection of community land under Article 63 of the Constitution. For clarity, Article 63 (1) provides that, “Community land shall vest in and be held by communities identified on the basis of ethnicity, culture or similar community of interests.” From the pleadings, we have discerned a number of concerns raised by the Complainants in asserting their rights to community land. Key in these concerns is the allegation that the impugned acquisition will interfere with their pastoral livelihood, dry-season grazing, access to water, and cultural heritage, and that no social, economic, or environmental impact assessment was undertaken. During the trial, CW2 asserted that the impugned acquisition would hinder access to Ewaso Nyiro river for purposes of watering for the animals. On its part, the Respondent through the testimony of Mr. Kipaa asserts that the acquisition does not affect access to Ewaso Nyiro river as the animal corridor to the river was not affected. Mr. Kipaa also testified that there were no objections raised during the inquiry. The Complainants did not advance evidence to support this assertion. However, the Complainants may not have access to this information at the moment considering the vast area covered by the suit property. Although the Respondent produced a map for the acquisition, we are not able to confirm with certainty that the acquisition map does not affect the animal corridor which is used by animals in accessing water from Ewaso Nyiro. Despite the fact that the impugned acquisition is ongoing, the concerns raised by the Complainants in regard to their rights as a community are critical and warrant consideration. Ms. Asiago for the Amicus submitted before us in this respect and underlined the disruptive nature of compulsory acquisition on community land without adequate safeguards. Ms. Asiago argued that compulsory acquisition that disrupts established communal systems of land use such as pastoralism, rotational grazing, or water resource sharing without adequate safeguards may undermine the ecological balance and resilience of the affected area. Counsel, therefore, called upon us to assess the environmental and intergenerational sustainability of the impugned acquisition. Ms. Asiago equally reminded us of the dictates of Articles 27 and 56 of the Constitution in respect of compulsory acquisition of community land in areas predominantly inhabited by historically marginalized groups. These two provisions guarantee equality before the law (Article 27) and impose a positive obligation on the state to protect minorities and marginalized groups (Article 56). Looking at the instant suit, it is apparent to us that despite the fact that the acquisition process has not been completed, the Respondent has not fully discharged its mandate in carrying out this process thus far. Compulsory acquisition of community land with its attendant effects on the rights of minorities and marginalized groups requires the Commission to take extra measures to ensure that those rights are protected every step of the way. The Commission must conduct a social impact assessment study of all aspects of the acquisition to determine how the same will affect the community in order to come up with measures to mitigate or eliminate negative effects. This requirement can be inferred as part of the necessary due diligence under Section 107 of the Land Act even though the Respondent has not developed a criteria as required under the law and admitted by RW1. In this case, for instance, the Complainants testified how the acquisition is likely to affect the animal corridor. This is a corridor that the animals use to access the Ewaso Nyiro river for watering purposes. We do not find the Respondent’s testimony that the corridor is not affected, without a comprehensive social impact assessment study, to be sufficient. It is also not sufficient for the Respondent to state that there were no objections raised during the inquiry. The burden is on the Respondent to demonstrate that it has taken into account all the socio-economic and cultural circumstances of the community when acquiring community land. This has to be contained in a social impact assessment study. Therefore, although it appears that the Respondent carried out an inquiry as required under the law, the special circumstances of the inhabitants of community land require the Respondent to go further in considering how the acquisition will affect the community. We are guided by the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights decision in the Ogiek Case which recognized the need for special measures in the protection of the rights of minorities and marginalized groups. Tied to the provisions of the Constitution that protect rights of minorities and marginalized groups is the proportionality assessment required under Article 40 (3) and the Land Act. Although the State’s exercise of eminent domain is qualified to the extent that the same is for a public purpose or in the public interest, a reading of the Constitution and the Land Act demonstrates that the State does not have a carte blanche in exercise of this power even where there is a public purpose or in the public interest. We agree with the submissions of the Amicus that acquisition should be undertaken in a manner that causes the least possible disruption. In Thuo and 51 Others (supra) we stated as follows: To our minds, Article 40(3) of the Constitution and Sections 107 and 110(1) of the Land Act lay down a test that must be satisfied before an approval is granted by the National Land Commission for acquisition of land. The test that must be satisfied is whether the necessity of the project outweighs the inconvenience likely to be suffered by the project affected persons. Although we are satisfied that the purpose indicated for the acquisition is a public purpose and also taking into consideration the strategic location of the suit property for security purposes the acquisition is necessary, it is upon the Respondent to be satisfied that the acquisition itself occasions the least disruption to the affected community. This also goes to the concern raised by the Complainants that the request for additional land was not justified. The Respondent is, therefore, required to comprehensively address the measures it has taken to ensure that the community affected is occasioned the least disruption in this process. This should be contained in a comprehensive social impact assessment study as we have already determined above. On whether the Respondent has complied with the obligation to determine proprietary interests and compensation due to the project affected persons, the Respondents have averred that this process has not been completed and the same shall be finalized and awards of compensation issued to the project affected persons. The Respondents have also indicated that concerns over the lease issued to Kamanga Holdings Limited have been taken into account and that the community will be compensated for the unexpired period of the lease. We shall not preempt that process as the same has not been completed. Tied to the determination of compensation payable and the issuance of awards is the requirement to be in possession of funds for compensation as required under Section 111(1A) of the Land Act. The requirement to ensure availability of funds for purposes of compensation flows from the Constitutional imperative under Article 40(3) to ensure that compensation is promptly done. As we held in Thuo and 51 Others (supra), “It is also necessary for the Commission to have confirmation of the funds in order to be satisfied that the intended use of the land by the acquiring authority is not “fanciful” but has been budgeted for and funds have been allocated for the project.” A closer reading of the Land Act shows deliberate effort to ensure that project affected persons are paid promptly upon acquisition of their properties. The Land Act specifically requires that the payment of compensation be done within 12 months from the date of taking of possession of the acquired land. The Respondent has averred that it has confirmation of availability of funds for compensation. It is also not reasonable to expect that the said funds would be in its possession before a determination on the amounts required for compensation. We take judicial notice that although the law requires the Commission to be in possession of compensation funds before commencing acquisition, a guarantee of availability of those funds from the acquiring entity is sufficient to commence the process. We also take judicial notice that ordinarily the acquiring entity will remit the funds for compensation upon presentation of a schedule of compensation by the Commission detailing the amounts of compensation payable to each project affected person. Besides, we note that the process of compulsory acquisition in respect of the suit property has not been completed. The Respondent has not issued awards of compensation as required under the law. Complaints raised in this respect are, therefore, premature. For the foregoing reasons and considering that this process is not yet complete, the appropriate reliefs that commend themselves to us are those in the nature of structural interdicts to ensure that the rights of the Complainants are safeguarded as the process continues: The Respondent be and is hereby directed to conduct a social impact assessment study of the acquisition in respect to L.R. No. Samburu/East Waso/1 (the “Suit Property”) and to file the same before the Tribunal within 90 days of the date hereof; and All other prayers are dismissed; Parties shall bear their own costs; This matter shall be mentioned in 90 days to confirm compliance to the Tribunal’s satisfaction. We thank counsel for the parties and the Amicus Curiae for the diligence with which they presented their cases and for assisting the Tribunal reach this determination.

LANDLORD AND JANE SARAH NYAMBURA THUO ........................................................... TENANT JUDGMENT Introduction 1. This judgment concerns a reference and Notice of Motion dated 25th September 2024 by the Landlord/Applicant seeking, inter alia, termination of the Tenant/Respondent’s controlled tenancy over Room 6 on Nyeri Municipality Block 2/69, eviction and vacant possession, leave to break into the premises should the Tenant decline to deliver possession, leave to levy distress for rent arrears alleged to be standing at Kshs. 1,010,480 as at August 2024, and police assistance from the O.C.S. Nyeri Police Station during the exercise. 2. The application is supported by the Landlord’s A\\ue000davit of even date wherein it is deposed that the Tenant has persistently defaulted in rent, that arrears have accrued over time, and that despite demands the Tenant has neither vacated nor regularized her rent account. The Landlord’s Notice of Motion also prayed for costs. 3. The Tenant opposes the application through a detailed Replying A\\ue000davit sworn on 17th June 2025 and later written submissions, contending that the arrears \\ue003gure is exaggerated and internally inconsistent, that she substantially complied with a prior Tribunal ruling ordering settlement of Kshs. 475,000 within ninety days, and that the Landlord’s attempts amount to harassment and a contrived push to evict her outside Cap 301. 4. The Tenant raised a Preliminary Objection dated 17th October 2024 asserting res judicata and functus o\\ue000cio arising from Nyeri BPRT Case No. 49 of 2023. By a reasoned ruling delivered on 17th January https://new.kenyalaw.org/akn/ke/judgment/kebprt/2025/425/eng@2025-10-09 1 2025, this Tribunal dismissed the objection, found the matter not barred, directed compliance, and ordered that the dispute proceeds to hearing of the reference with parties exchanging rent statements. 5. The dismissal of the Preliminary Objection resolved the jurisdictional and procedural challenge and left for determination the merits of the Landlord’s prayers and the Tenant’s opposition. 6. The Landlord’s Reference cites persistent rent default and seeks orders to regain possession and to recover accrued arrears through distress. The contemporaneous Notice of Motion seeks termination of tenancy and order to vacate; eviction with leave to break in and police assistance; leave to levy distress to recover Kshs. 1,010,480 as at August 2024 and mesne pro\\ue003ts at Kshs. 33,060 per month; O.C.S. Nyeri to ensure compliance; and costs of the suit. 7. The Landlord depones that the Tenant occupies the business premises at a monthly rent of Kshs. 33,060, that the Tenant was previously engaged in BPRT E049/2023 which was later dismissed, and that arrears stood at Kshs. 1,010,480 as at August 2024. She deposes that there were failed attempts at amicable resolution, requests for eviction, and prays to recover arrears by distress. 8. There was an order for inter-partes hearing on 30/09/2024 and later directions for exchange of rent accounts and compliance with Order 11 of the Civil Procedure Rules within 21 days after dismissal of the Preliminary Objection. 9. The Tenant’s Replying A\\ue000davit sets out her tenancy history, stating that the rent was Kshs. 25,000 (later Kshs. 29,000) with a security deposit of Kshs. 75,000, and narrates earlier disputes including BPRT 47 of 2021 and BPRT 49 of 2023. She maintains that as at 4th June 2024, arrears were determined at Kshs. 475,000 payable within ninety days, and avers substantial compliance through payments of Kshs. 425,000 (later stating Kshs. 450,000), leaving a lower balance than claimed. She accuses the Landlord of in\\ue004ated and duplicated computation (e.g., 2023 entries) and harassment. She proposes a structured plan to clear remaining arrears by instalments. 10. The Landlord’s written submissions frame issues around default, res judicata/functus (disputing their application), and costs. They assert continuing arrears, cite Section 4 of the Distress for Rent Act (Cap 293), invoke Cap 301 termination provisions, and rely on authorities for the landlord’s entitlement to rent and to resort to distress if ordinary recovery fails. A landlord’s rent account statement is referenced, indicating payments to August 2025 and a net balance due. 11. On the other hand, the Tenant urges dismissal, re-emphasizing the \\ue003nality of prior orders up to June 2024 on arrears, challenges the credibility of the Landlord’s computations, alleges constructive eviction/harassment, invokes Article 47 and the Fair Administrative Action Act, and prays for continued protection of quiet enjoyment. She pegs current arrears at a far lower \\ue003gure and o\\ue005ers structured payment. 12. There is no serious contest that the Tenant remains in possession and is conducting business at the premises. The core factual controversy is the quantum and period of rent arrears and the legal consequences \\ue004owing therefrom. 13. The Landlord has exhibited a demand letter dated 5th August 2025 showing a month-by-month arrears schedule spanning November 2021 through August 2025, with the rent escalating from Kshs. 25,000 to Kshs. 29,000 and subsequently Kshs. 33,060, and summations of outstanding balances net of certain payments. 14. The Tenant has exhibited receipts and narrates payments made post the ruling of 20th June 2024 in BPRT 49 of 2023, emphasizing substantial compliance with the ordered Kshs. 475,000 within the 90-day period and acknowledging a smaller residual balance (variously cited as Kshs. 25,000 or https://new.kenyalaw.org/akn/ke/judgment/kebprt/2025/425/eng@2025-10-09 2 Kshs. 50,000 plus some current months). She disputes the mathematical validity and legal propriety of including periods already accounted for in earlier proceedings. 15. There is thus a narrow common ground: some arrears remain outstanding. The extent is disputed: the Landlord pleads Kshs. 1,010,480 as at August 2024 whereas the Tenant pegs a far lower composite \\ue003gure inclusive of current months post-June 2024. The dispute on quantum does not extinguish the landlord’s right to lawful recovery mechanisms for rent that is due. 16. We have perused the court record in respect of Nyeri BPRT Case No. E049 of 2023 and noted that on 4th June 2024, the Tenant was ordered to pay a sum of Kshs 475,000/= within 90 days thereof. The said amount was the admitted rent arrears for the period up to April 2024. 17. The Tenant claims to have substantially paid the said amount leaving an undisclosed balance. The case was subsequently dismissed on 22nd August 2024 for want of prosecution by Hon. Mike Makori. The Landlord is therefore entitled to pursue any unpaid rent from November 2022 to date through the instant proceedings. B. Issues for Determination 18. From the pleadings, a\\ue000davits, exhibits and submissions, the following issues arise for determination: i. What is the proper legal framework governing recovery of rent arrears and termination/ eviction for a controlled tenancy under Cap 301, and how does the Distress for Rent Act (Cap 293) operate in this context? ii. Whether, on the evidence, the Tenant is in rent arrears and, if so, whether the Landlord is entitled to levy distress for rent. iii. Whether the Landlord has met the statutory threshold for termination and eviction under Section 4(2) of Cap 301. iv. What orders should issue as to timelines for settlement and as to costs. C. Legal Analysis & Determination 19. Landlord’s right to rent & distress: The Tenant’s continued occupation without full rent payment engages the landlord’s right to rent. Kenyan courts recognize that a landlord is entitled to rent unless there is lawful justi\\ue003cation for non-payment; this principle is re\\ue004ected in decisions such as Republic v Business Premises Rent Tribunal & Another ex parte Albert Kigera Mugo [2017] eKLR. In this case, the Tenant admits outstanding sums (placing them at a lower \\ue003gure) and proposes instalments, thereby acknowledging indebtedness, which in law supports recourse to distress subject to statutory safeguards. 20. Distress for Rent Act (Cap 293): Section 4(1) permits lawful distress and, after the prescribed notice, sale of distrained goods for the best obtainable price to satisfy rent and charges. The Landlord’s prayer aligns with this route. The disputed quantum does not negate entitlement to distress; it merely informs the rent account to be struck and the extent of recovery. 21. Controlled tenancies & eviction: Section 4(2) of the Landlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotels and Catering Establishments) Act (Cap 301) stipulates that a landlord who wishes to terminate or alter to the detriment of a tenant must give a statutory notice in the prescribed form. 22. Case law such as Saheb v Hassanally [1981] eKLR and Caledonia Supermarket Ltd v Kenya National Examinations Council [2000] eKLR underscores the legal position that eviction absent a valid Section https://new.kenyalaw.org/akn/ke/judgment/kebprt/2025/425/eng@2025-10-09 3 4(2) notice is unlawful. In this case, no valid Section 4(2) notice is exhibited in the current record, and previous notices have been overtaken by subsequent proceedings. Accordingly, while rent recovery is available by distress, eviction cannot issue. 23. Mesne pro\\ue003ts: The decision in Hotel Premises Ltd v Willesden Investments Ltd [2009] eKLR) conceptualize mesne pro\\ue003ts as damages for trespass post-termination. As termination has not lawfully occurred here, mesne pro\\ue003ts are inapposite at this stage; the Tenant is not yet a trespasser. 24. Res judicata & functus: The Tenant’s earlier Preliminary Objection alleging res judicata was dismissed on 17th January 2025; the Tribunal found the prior suits had not culminated in \\ue003nal determinations barring the present reliefs and noted ongoing arrears and compliance issues. The res judicata elements articulated in IEBC v Maina Kiai (2017) eKLR were not met on the record as summarized in that ruling. The merits therefore remain for determination, and we approach them afresh. 25. Burden and standard: Sections 107–109 of the Evidence Act (Cap 80) impose upon the Landlord the burden to prove default and the right to the reliefs sought; the Tenant bears the evidential burden on special matters within her knowledge such as payments. 26. On the record, both parties tendered documents: The Landlord tendered a schedule of arrears and the Tenant tendered receipts, and both \\ue003led submissions. With the Tenant’s admission of a residual balance, the balance of probabilities favours a \\ue003nding of arrears due and payable, albeit the precise \\ue003gure must be reconciled. 27. Having perused the pleadings and the documentary record, the Tribunal is satis\\ue003ed that this is a controlled tenancy within the meaning of Cap 301. The Tenant has been in occupation since at least 2017 and is carrying on a business in Room 6. The Landlord contends that default became persistent from 2022/2023, with the arrears allegedly compounding into seven \\ue003gures by August 2024; the Tenant counters that as at 4th June 2024, the Tribunal in BPRT 49 of 2023 quanti\\ue003ed arrears at Kshs. 475,000 payable within ninety days and that she substantially complied, leaving only a small balance and some current months. The record of the Preliminary Objection ruling corroborates that there were subsequent payments post-June 2024 and a residual balance that remained outstanding. 28. The Tenant also attacks the credibility of the Landlord’s schedule, asserting duplication for 2023 and in\\ue004ation for 2024/2025 in the demand letter of 5th August 2025. While these criticisms may bear upon the ultimate arithmetic of the account, they do not erase the Tenant’s own admission of indebtedness. 29. Under Sections 107–109 of the Evidence Act, the party asserting a fact must prove it; however, where a debtor admits owing a balance, the controversy shifts to quantum rather than liability. The appropriate course is to permit recovery mechanisms for the lawful amount and to direct parties to reconcile the account in accordance with the rents lawfully agreed or determined, with credit given for all payments proved by receipts. 30. On the remedy, we align with the holdings in ex parte Albert Kigera Mugo and Palmy Company Ltd: where a tenant persists in default and ordinary requests fail, a landlord may lawfully invoke distress under Cap 293, provided procedural safeguards are observed (including proper inventory, statutory notices, and conduct by a licensed auctioneer). 31. In the present case, the Tenant’s continued occupation and admitted arrears justify allowing distress limited to the lawful amount ultimately found due on reconciliation. Any dispute as to items distrained, valuation, or sale must be dealt with according to Cap 293 and applicable auctioneers’ regulations. https://new.kenyalaw.org/akn/ke/judgment/kebprt/2025/425/eng@2025-10-09 4 32. The plea for eviction requires stricter scrutiny. The Tribunal’s jurisdiction to sanction eviction stems from Cap 301 and is conditioned upon a valid notice to terminate under Section 4(2). The jurisprudence of Saheb v Hassanally and Caledonia Supermarket v KNEC remains good law: eviction in the absence of a compliant notice is unlawful. No such notice is exhibited by the landlord. It follows that even if arrears are due, eviction cannot be decreed. The Landlord’s recourse remains distress, but not termination or vacant possession in the absence of a valid notice that has taken e\\ue005ect. 33. The Tenant has also pleaded harassment and constructive eviction. The Tribunal’s protective mandate under Cap 301 obliges it to guard against self-help tactics or coercive conduct designed to dislodge a tenant without due process. However, the Tenant’s remedy for harassment lies in injunctive relief which has not been sought by her in this case. On the present motion, framed around eviction and distress, the cogent legal remedy is to decline eviction and to allow distress for arrears that are due and owing. 34. On mesne pro\\ue003ts, the law views these as damages accruing after lawful termination where the occupant becomes a trespasser. Because termination under Section 4(2) has not occurred, a claim for mesne pro\\ue003ts is premature. Any reference to mesne pro\\ue003ts in the Landlord’s prayers is therefore declined. 35. Res judicata and functus o\\ue000cio: The Tribunal has already spoken via the ruling of 17th January 2025; this judgement proceeds on that basis. For completeness, we observe that the Tenant’s argument about \\ue003nality of the Kshs. 475,000 \\ue003gure as at April 2024 does not bar the present consideration of arrears accruing thereafter; neither does it relieve the Tenant of the obligation to prove payments against the running account. 36. The Tribunal takes judicial notice that commercial tenancies involve periodic obligations; arrears must be tracked month-by-month, and subsequent defaults are amenable to fresh reliefs without o\\ue005ending res judicata. 37. The equities: The Tenant operates a small business and has expressed willingness to clear arrears by instalments. The Landlord, as property owner, is entitled to timely rent and to statutory remedies for non-payment. Cap 301 balances these interests by protecting tenure through mandatory notices for termination, and preserving the landlord’s rent recovery tools through distress. The orders we frame below honour both sides of this statutory balance. 38. Reconciliation directive: In view of the contested computations, we direct a structured reconciliation anchored on contemporaneous records. The Landlord shall \\ue003le a chronological rent ledger from November 2022 to the \\ue003ling date showing for each month: rent due, amount paid, date and mode of payment, receipt number, balance carried forward, and any arrears. 39. The Tenant shall within 14 days thereafter \\ue003le a matching schedule with receipts and bank con\\ue003rmations. Either party may highlight variances. This exercise shall therefore suspend the distress process pending reconciliation of the rent account. 40. Time to pay upon reconciliation of the rent account: To avoid undue hardship to the Tenant’s business, we shall allow a short runway to clear the arrears. The evidence shows the Tenant has previously honored structured payments when ordered. Consistent with that history, we shall allow sixty (60) days from the date of reconciliation to settle the arrears, failing which the Landlord will be at liberty to proceed with the distress. 41. Police assistance: Given that eviction is declined and distress must comply with Cap 293, there is no basis on the current record for a blanket police supervision order to “break in” for eviction. However, consistent with the Auctioneers Act and Cap 293, police assistance may be sought administratively if https://new.kenyalaw.org/akn/ke/judgment/kebprt/2025/425/eng@2025-10-09 5 necessary to keep the peace during a lawful distress. This judgment does not pre-authorize forcible eviction or lock-out. 42. Costs: Both parties have partially succeeded. In exercise of our discretion under Section 12(1)(k) of Cap 301 and Section 27 of the Civil Procedure Act, we direct each party to bear its own costs. D. Disposition & Orders 43. In line with the Court of Appeal decision in Weston Gitonga & 10 others Vs Peter Rugu Gikanga & another [2017] eKLR, we shall issue a preliminary decree in the following terms: a. The Landlord shall within 14 days hereof \\ue003le a chronological rent ledger from November 2022 to the \\ue003ling date, showing for each month: rent due, amount paid, date and mode of payment, receipt number, balance carried forward. b. The Tenant shall within 14 days thereafter \\ue003le a matching schedule with receipts and bank con\\ue003rmations. Either party may highlight variances. c. This exercise shall therefore suspend the distress process pending reconciliation of the rent account. d. The prayer for eviction and vacant possession is declined for want of a valid notice of termination under Section 4(2) of Cap 301. e. The Tenant shall clear the determined rent arrears within sixty (60) days of reconciliation, failing which the Landlord shall be at liberty to proceed with lawful distress. f.

Dispute Background 1. The Tenant/Applicant, \\ue000led a Reference dated 29th May 2025 under Section 12(4) of the Landlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotels and Catering Establishments) Act, Cap 301, together with a Notice of Motion of even date. The Applicant sought orders restraining the Respondents from proclaiming, attaching, seizing, or interfering with its quiet possession of business premises situate on Land Parcel Kiambaa/Kanunga/2137, and further sought that police assistance be provided in enforcement. 2. The application is supported by the Supporting A\\ue003davit of James Gicharu Karanga, the Managing Director of the Applicant Company, sworn on 29th May 2025. In response, the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Respondents \\ue000led a Replying A\\ue003davit sworn by Hussein Ole Shero Baluch on 13th June 2025 and submissions dated 31st July 2025, opposing the application. 3. The Applicant avers that on 13th May 2022, it entered into a written Sub-Lease Agreement with the 1st Respondent, for occupation of part of the premises known as Kiambaa/Kanunga/2137 (Annexure JGK-1). The Applicant claims it has been in uninterrupted possession since then, running a garage and car wash, and has heavily invested in the premises evidenced by receipts annexed as JGK-3. https://new.kenyalaw.org/akn/ke/judgment/kebprt/2025/424/eng@2025-10-08 1 4. The Applicant contends it has at all times paid rent to the 1st Respondent, as demonstrated by rent receipts annexed as JGK-2. It states that on 10th March 2025, the 2nd and 3rd Respondents issued a demand letter to the 1st Respondent alleging arrears and instructed Moran Auctioneers to levy distress. On 9th May 2025, the 4th Respondent issued a proclamation attaching the Applicant’s assets (Annexures JGK-4 and JGK-5). 5. The Applicant argues that the proclamation was illegal as it was not privy to the dispute between the landlords and the 1st Respondent. It fears irreparable harm, including closure of business, loss of clientele and reputational damage unless the Tribunal intervenes. 6. The 2nd and 3rd Respondents, as administrators of the estate of the late Agnes Wanjiru Waweru, annexed the Grant of Letters of Administration (H1) and the Certi\\ue000cate of Con\\ue000rmation of Grant (H2) showing bene\\ue000cial ownership of the suit property. 6. They aver that the 1st Respondent was their lawful tenant under a Lease Agreement dated 3rd May 2019 (H4) and an Addendum dated 4th July 2019 (H5) extending the tenancy for six years up to 4th October 2025. That the 1st Respondent defaulted in rent, accumulating arrears of KES. 1,333,585, prompting them to lawfully instruct Moran Auctioneers to levy distress. 7. The Respondents deny any knowledge of the Applicant and contend that there is no landlord–tenant relationship between them and T Gas Limited. They argue that the alleged sublease between the Applicant and the 1st Respondent was done without their consent, contrary to Section 3 of Cap 301 which prohibits subletting without landlord’s authority. 8. They rely on the legal maxim Ex turpi causa non oritur actio (no cause of action arises from an illegal act), citing Scott v Brown, Doering & McNab Company (1892) 2 QB 724, and local authorities including Friends Hotel Kakamega Limited v Commissioner of Domestic Taxes [2023] KETAT 942 KLR, Kenya Railways Corporation v Mamasu Enterprises Ltd & Others [2024] KEELC 13415, and Muthoni v Mwathi (BPRT E006/2021) to argue that an illegal subtenancy cannot be protected. 9. They further cite Farkhandas Nurmohamed Abdulkader V Mohamed Hasham Bakarani & Nasserpuria Memon Jamat [2014] KEHC 4269 (KLR) and Nairobi Housing Development Ltd v Highridge Corner Bar Ltd [1979] KEHC 38 (KLR) to reinforce that a tenancy created without landlord consent is void and unenforceable. 10. In submissions, they emphasize that the Applicant has no locus standi, is a trespasser on the premises, and cannot use the Tribunal to shield itself from lawful distress aimed at the 1st Respondent. B. Issues for Determination and Analysis 11. The following issues arise for determination; a. Whether there exists a landlord–tenant relationship between the parties. b. Whether the Applicant/Tenant is entitled to the injunctive orders sought in the application. c. Who shall bear the costs of the application? Issue (a) Whether there exists a Landlord–Tenant Relationship between the parties. 12. Section 2 of Cap 301 de\\ue000nes a landlord and a tenant as follows; “landlord”, in relation to a tenancy, means the person for the time being entitled, as between himself and the tenant, to the rents and pro\\ue000ts of the premises payable under the tenancy; https://new.kenyalaw.org/akn/ke/judgment/kebprt/2025/424/eng@2025-10-08 2 “tenant” in relation to a tenancy means the person for the time being entitled to the tenancy whether or not he is in occupation of the holding, and includes a sub-tenant; 13. Section 3 of the Schedule in Cap 301 expressly prohibits a tenant from transferring, parting with possession of, or subletting premises without the consent of the landlord. 14. The Applicant admits that its interest arises from a Sub-Lease with the 1st Respondent. However, the 2nd and 3rd Respondents, being administrators and bene\\ue000cial owners of the suit premises, have denied giving any such consent. The authorities cited, including Muthoni v Mwathi (BPRT E006 of 2021), con\\ue000rm that in the absence of landlord consent, there is no valid landlord–tenant relationship enforceable under Cap 301. 15. We therefore \\ue000nd that the Applicant has no recognized tenancy with the landlords (2nd and 3rd Respondents) and is a stranger to the estate property. Issue (b) Whether the Applicant/Tenant is entitled to the orders sought in the application 16. The injunctive relief sought is premised on the Applicant being a protected tenant. Since no valid tenancy exists between the Applicant and the landlords, the Applicant lacks the requisite legal standing to seek protection under Cap 301. The proclamation by Moran Auctioneers (4th Respondent) was directed against the 1st Respondent, the lawful tenant in arrears, and cannot be invalidated at the instance of a subtenant whose occupancy is illegal. 17. As held in Farkhandas Nurmohamed Abdulkader v Mohamed Hasham Bakarani & Nasserpuria Memon Jamat [2014] eKLR, “A sub-tenancy created without the knowledge and consent of the landlord cannot be recognized or protected under the provisions of Cap 301. The protection a\\ue004orded by the Act is only available to tenants who are lawfully in occupation under a tenancy sanctioned by the landlord.” 18. Similarly, in Scott v Brown (1892) 2 QB 724, the court declined to enforce rights arising from an illegality. Guided by these authorities, the Applicant is not entitled to the injunctive relief sought in the application dated 29th May 2025. Issue (c) Who shall bear the Costs of the application? 19. Under Section 12(1)(k) of Cap. 301, Laws of Kenya, costs of any suit before this Tribunal are in its discretion but always follow the event unless for good reasons otherwise ordered. We shall order costs of the suit to the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Respondents. C. Orders 20. In conclusion, the following \\ue000nal orders commend to us; a. The Tribunal \\ue000nds that there is no landlord–tenant relationship between the Applicant and the 2nd and 3rd Respondents. b. The application dated 29th May 2025 is hereby dismissed. c. All interim orders are hereby discharged d. Costs of this application are awarded to the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Respondents. https://new.kenyalaw.org/akn/ke/judgment/kebprt/2025/424/eng@2025-10-08 3 e.

CLAIMANT AND CINE INVESTMENT LIMITED .................................................. 1ST RESPONDENT NATIONAL LAND COMMISSION ............................................ 2ND RESPONDENT BUSINESS REGISTRATION SERVICE ...................................... 3RD RESPONDENT RULING 1. This matter comes up for directions today in respect of the Claimant’s Statement of Claim and Application dated 12th September 2025. In the application \\ue000led under Certi\\ue000cate of Urgency, the Claimant seeks, inter alia, leave to serve the 1st Respondent through substituted service and issuance of a temporary injunction against the 4th Respondent (sic) restraining the said Respondent from continuing with the process of compulsory acquisition in respect of a notice of intention to acquire published in Kenya Gazette Notice number 2372 of 24th February 2023. 2. The Claimant avers that the suit is \\ue000led in the public interest to protect public funds from possible fraud. It is alleged that the 1st Respondent is a fraudulent entity that has been established with the intention to carry out fraudulent unlawful, illegal activities which involves taking of public funds from the 2nd Respondent. The Claimant further avers that she has been unable to con\\ue000rm the legal status of the 1st Respondent through a search at the 3rd Respondent’s registry and platform. She, therefore, avers that the 1st Respondent “does not exist in law and statutory records.” 3. Having perused the instant application and the Statement of Claim, I make the following observations: a. The instant suit is similar to another suit which was struck out by this tribunal for lack of jurisdiction being Esmail v Abdeel Enterprises Limited & 3 others [2025] KELAT 173 (KLR), https://new.kenyalaw.org/akn/ke/judgment/kelat/2025/194/eng@2025-10-08 1 where the Tribunal made a determination that the dispute in the case involved a question of the legal status of the then 3rd Respondent who is now the 1st Respondent. b. The present suit similarly invites the Tribunal to venture into matters beyond its jurisdiction. The Claimant purports that the 1st Respondent is engaged in fraud but at the same time alleges that the said entity does not exist. These are matters within the mandate of the Ethics and AntiCorruption Commission. c. Even though the Claimant purports to \\ue000le the instant suit “in the public interest” the background makes it clear that the Claimant is pursuing an underlying dispute before the wrong forum. It is a classic case of abuse of the court process. Munyao Sila, J in County Council of Nandi vs. Ezekiel Kibet Rutto & 6 Others [2013] eKLR observed as follows: A pleading that is an abuse of the process of Court in my view encompasses scandalous, frivolous, or vexatious pleadings but goes a little further to take care of situations that may not otherwise be encapsulated in the de\\ue000nition of the three preceding words. They can encompass a situation where a litigant is using the process of court in the wrong way, not for purposes of agitating a right, but for other extraneous reasons 4. Courts of law are not powerless when faced with outright abuse of their processes. Such abuse must be stopped right in its tracks. As observed in County Council of Nandi (supra): The court through the provisions of Order 2 Rule 15 is given leeway to strike out pleadings that are scandalous, frivolous, vexatious or otherwise an abuse of the process of court. Before striking out such pleading, the court needs to make an examination whether such pleadings are scandalous, frivolous, vexatious or otherwise an abuse of the process of law. If they are, then a court would be perfectly entitled to strike such pleadings out because essentially it is not fair and neither is it worthy having a defendant shoulder the burden of such litigation. 5. It is my \\ue000nding that the pleadings in this case are an abuse of the court process and pursuant to Order 2 Rule 15 (1) (d) of the Civil procedure Rules, I hereby strike out the suit in its entirety with no orders as to costs as the Respondents have not \\ue000led any responses.

APPLICANT AND PET CARE SERVICES LIMITED ....................................................... RESPONDENT RULING A. Background 1. The Respondent/Landlord \\ue000led a Notice of Preliminary Objection dated 18th August 2025 seeking to strike out the consolidated references in BPRT E360 of 2025 and BPRT E550 of 2025, contending that the tenancies between the parties are not controlled tenancies within the meaning of Section 2 of the Landlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotels and Catering Establishments) Act (Cap 301, Laws of Kenya). 2. The Landlord’s objection is anchored on two main grounds: that the lease agreements are for terms exceeding \\ue000ve years and therefore outside the purview of controlled tenancies, and that the Tribunal therefore lacks jurisdiction to hear and determine the dispute. 3. The Tenant/Applicant opposed the objection through submissions dated 5th September 2025, arguing that the leases in question contain termination clauses capable of invocation by either party before the expiry of \\ue000ve years, and are therefore controlled tenancies under Section 2(1)(b)(ii) of Cap 301. B. Issues for Determination 4. The issues for determination are as follows: i. Whether the Preliminary Objection meets the established legal threshold. https://new.kenyalaw.org/akn/ke/judgment/kebprt/2025/423/eng@2025-10-09 1 ii. Whether the tenancies between the parties qualify as controlled tenancies under Section 2 of Cap 301 so as to confer jurisdiction on this Tribunal. iii. Who is liable to pay costs of the objection? C. Analysis and Determination i. Whether the Preliminary Objection Meets the legal threshold 5. In the celebrated case of Mukisa Biscuit Manufacturing Co. Ltd v West End Distributors Ltd [1969] EA 696, Law J.A. stated: “A preliminary objection consists of a point of law which has been pleaded, or which arises by clear implication out of pleadings, and which if argued as a preliminary point may dispose of the suit.” 6. Similarly, in Oraro v Mbaja [2005] eKLR, Ojwang J. (as he then was) emphasized that: “A preliminary objection cannot be raised if any fact has to be ascertained or if what is sought is the exercise of judicial discretion.” 7. In the present matter, the Landlord’s objection is premised on the assertion that the leases are for terms exceeding \\ue000ve years and are therefore, not controlled. However, the existence and interpretation of termination clauses within the leases are contested factual issues requiring the Tribunal to examine the actual lease documents, their wording, and the intention of the parties. 8. Such examination takes the objection beyond the realm of pure law into factual inquiry, contrary to the principles laid down in Mukisa Biscuit and Oraro v Mbaja. Therefore, the objection does not qualify as a pure point of law capable of disposing of the suit in limine. ii Whether the Leases Create Controlled Tenancies Under Section 2 of Cap 301 9. Section 2(1)(b)(ii) of Cap 301 de\\ue000nes a controlled tenancy as one which inter-alia: “... has been reduced into writing and which contains provision for termination, otherwise than for breach of covenant, within \\ue000ve years from the commencement thereof.” 10. The Tenant has demonstrated through annexed copies of the leases that each of them contains a termination clause permitting either party to terminate the tenancy by notice before the expiry of \\ue000ve years. 11. The Court of Appeal in Khalif Jele Mohamed & another v Republic [2019] eKLR held that: “If such a tenancy has provision for termination, which can be invoked at any time during the term, it is a controlled tenancy under Section 2(1)(b)(ii) of Cap 301.” 12. Likewise, in Githiomi v Maina [2025] KECA 175, the Court observed that: “Although the lease was for a period exceeding \\ue000ve years, the presence of a termination clause capable of invocation by either party within the \\ue000rst \\ue000ve years rendered it a controlled tenancy within the meaning of Section 2 of Cap 301.” https://new.kenyalaw.org/akn/ke/judgment/kebprt/2025/423/eng@2025-10-09 2 13. This reasoning has also been consistently followed by the Tribunal, as in Salat v Nnicom Investment Co. Ltd (BPRT E1026/2022), where it was held that: “A tenancy agreement that contains a mutual termination clause permitting termination otherwise than for breach and within \\ue000ve years from commencement is a controlled tenancy under Section 2(1)(b)(ii).” 14. The Tribunal \\ue000nds that the leases herein fall squarely within this principle. The existence of mutual termination provisions brings the tenancies within the statutory de\\ue000nition of controlled tenancies, thereby conferring jurisdiction on this Tribunal to entertain the dispute. 15. The Landlord relied heavily on Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd v Popatlal Madhavji & Bros. [2019] eKLR, Nilerch Investment Co. v Ontulili Investment Ltd (BPRT E1119/2023), and Omega Fire Ministries Int’l v Paragon Property Consultants Ltd (BPRT E1044/2024) to argue that the leases herein are not controlled. 16. These authorities are, however, distinguishable. In Popatlal (supra), the lease did not contain any termination clause. Similarly, in Nilerch and Omega Fire Ministries, the Tribunal found that the user of the premises was not a shop, hotel, or catering establishment, and that the leases lacked early termination provisions. 17. In contrast, the present leases relate to business premises used for the Tenant’s security services and training business, which falls within the commercial category contemplated by Cap 301, and contain express mutual termination clauses exercisable otherwise than for breach and within \\ue000ve years. 18. The distinguishing feature in the cited cases is therefore the absence of a termination clause, which is precisely the element that brings the present tenancy within the ambit of Cap 301. iii On Jurisdiction 19. The Landlord’s argument that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction is untenable once it is established that the tenancies are controlled within the meaning of Section 2. The Tribunal’s jurisdiction under Section 12(1) of Cap 301 extends to all controlled tenancies, and once such a tenancy is shown to exist, this Tribunal must exercise its statutory mandate. 20. The invocation of The Owners of Motor Vessel “Lillian S” v Caltex Oil (Kenya) Ltd [1989] KLR 1 on the doctrine of jurisdiction is therefore misplaced, as the factual foundation of jurisdiction under Cap 301 has been properly demonstrated. iv. Costs 21. Section 12(1)(k) of Cap 301 expressly empowers this Tribunal to award costs as it deems \\ue000t. The provision states that the Tribunal may “award costs as it deems \\ue000t in any proceedings before it.” 22. In exercise of this discretion, the Tribunal is guided by the general principle that costs follow the event unless the circumstances dictate otherwise. Having found the Preliminary Objection unmerited, the costs shall follow the event. D. Final Orders 23. In the result, the Tribunal \\ue000nds and holds as follows: https://new.kenyalaw.org/akn/ke/judgment/kebprt/2025/423/eng@2025-10-09 3 a. The Preliminary Objection dated 18th August 2025 does not meet the threshold of a pure point of law. b. The leases between the parties contain termination clauses exercisable within \\ue000ve years, thereby qualifying as controlled tenancies under Section 2(1)(b)(ii) of the Landlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotels and Catering Establishments) Act (Cap 301). c. The Tribunal consequently has jurisdiction to hear and determine the consolidated matters. d. The Preliminary Objection is hereby dismissed with costs to the Tenant/Applicant. It is so ordered.
